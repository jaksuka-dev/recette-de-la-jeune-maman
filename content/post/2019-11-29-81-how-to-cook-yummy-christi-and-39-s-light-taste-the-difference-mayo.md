  4. It&#8217;s 1/4 tsp of sea salt. less if that works best.. 
  5. You need 1 of medium lemon. I have used lime as well.. 

Well to start, Miracle Whip isn't considered mayonnaise at all because it doesn't meet the requirements to be mayo {the USDA requires anything labeled.

  7. Here's a few tips on how to ensure your mayo doesn't fail. First, make sure you use light olive oil, not extra-virgin. EVOO is way too heavy.) You can also use a high-oleic safflower sunflower oil, and my personal favorite grape seed oil.

The flavor of all four of these oils is very mild, so they're ideal for making mayo. I've experimented with other oils, and find people don't care for the taste of other oils like walnut, avocado etc.. 

Ive had great success with mayo since starting on this plan in July. I was buying one particular brand of light olive oil in a smaller container, but yesterday decided to switch to a Its still a high quality oil. Well, I made the mayo today and it emulsified just fine, b. Duncan has long said that vegan mayonnaise is just as good if not BETTER than regular mayo, and therefore there is zero reason for regular mayo to exist. But can he tell the difference in a blind taste test?
