Does tofu egg salad taste like real egg salad? You will have to try it for yourself, but even my non-vegan friends and family love it! Uses for an eggless salad: Keep the vegan tofu egg salad the fridge and just spread it on a slice of bread, rice cakes, or crackers for a quick easy lunch or snack. I became addicted to the fluorescent yellow of the turmeric-laced tofu and admired how rich and satisfying tofu could be.

I've been trying to tweak a version of this high-protein, low-cholesterol picnic. I make this quiche without eggs. The tofu gives it a good texture. I've brought it to potlucks where friends aren't vegetarian.no one ever knew! Egg Tofu is Japanese steamed tofu made of eggs and dashi mixture that is steamed till firm, chilled, then served with a dashi and soy sauce broth.
