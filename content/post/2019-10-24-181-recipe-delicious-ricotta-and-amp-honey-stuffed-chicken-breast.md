Bobby's Ricotta Cheesecake tastes just as decadent as a traditional one. Fennel and red chili flakes amp up the flavor of these cheesy meatballs. A simple marriage of ricotta cheese, egg, and a Ricotta gives this sauce a cheesy tanginess that we don't get with heavy cream. I love to top this pasta with lots of ricotta salata, a great summer cheese. A soft Italian curd cheese made from whey, which is drained and then lightly 'cooked'.
