Today I am going to share with you my favourite vegan Honey Mustard Sauce. Honey mustard sauce means a lot of different things to me, but mostly what it means is that when I make it, I am going to get to eat something that will be dipped in sauce. You can cook Spicey honey mustard dip using 3 ingredients and 1 steps. Here is how you cook that. 

### Ingredients of Spicey honey mustard dip

  1. You need 4 tbsp of Equal parts raw honey. 
  2. You need 4 tbsp of Equal parts spicy brown mustard. 
  3. You need 1 tsp of stone ground mustard. 

I know. honey mustard is just, well, honey and mustard pretty much, but recently I had the opportunity to give Colman's mustard products a try and let me tell you, if you want to bump your mustard up above and beyond spicy mustard, yes even those we love so much down here in The. This EASY Honey Mustard Recipe is perfect sauce for dipping, but can double as a salad dressing, or sandwich spread. In this episode I'll show you how to make my Honey Mustard Dipping Sauce recipe. Serve this almost-too-easy honey-mustard dipping sauce with anything from chicken skewers, to crispy potato wedges, to mini meatballs for a quick and easy appetizer. 

### Spicey honey mustard dip instructions

  1. Mix well, add a little more honey if you want it on the sweeter side. 

This honey mustard sauce is sweet with a little kick. It includes mayonnaise, spicy brown mustard, honey, and a little cayenne pepper. You could always decrease the cayenne pepper or leave it out if you do not like a little spice. I think it adds the perfect balance between sweet and a little kick. I love to dip chicken strips or nuggets in it, but it can also be used to dip veggies or anything else in.
