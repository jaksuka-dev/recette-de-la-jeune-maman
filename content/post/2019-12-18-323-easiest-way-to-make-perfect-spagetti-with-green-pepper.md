Espaguetis (Dominican Spaghetti) will help you surprise friends and family with this unusual but flavorful spaghetti dish. Stir in the lemon zest and juice, basil and spaghetti (reserve some pasta water) and toss together, adding a little of the pasta water until nicely coated. You can have Spagetti with green pepper using 10 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you cook that.
