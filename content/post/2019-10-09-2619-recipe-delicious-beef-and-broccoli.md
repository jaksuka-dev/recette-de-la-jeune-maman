This is an easy and tasty beef with broccoli version that I enjoy eating with warm rice. The beef is tender and flavorful, while the broccoli is nice and crisp. It is the same version that I have been making for my family as far as I can remember. This classic Chinese beef and broccoli recipe is quick and easy to make homemade, and tastes even better than the restaurant version! Beef and broccoli is one of the easiest Chinese takeout recipes that you can make at home.
