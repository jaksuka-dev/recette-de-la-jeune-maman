Many of the plastic-bagged-breads you'll find at the store that is "whole wheat" contain a bunch of additives to get it to rise high and taste sweet. Who wants all that added junk anyways? Happily, the whole-wheat variety is just as fast to prepare as regular couscous. Lemon zest is a delicious accent to nutty Parmesan in this I could not find whole-wheat couscous at the regular grocery store and so used regular and this recipe was very delicious. Hard to believe it is healthy!
