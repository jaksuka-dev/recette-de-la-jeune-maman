### Blueberry Lemon Spice Jam instructions

  1. Puree blueberries in a blender or food processor. Add everything except the sugar to a stock pot and bring to a boil on high heat stirring constantly making sure to scrap the bottom.. 
  2. When at a full boil add the sugar. Continue to stir constantly until it comes to another full boil. Boil for a minute and remove from heat.. 
  3. Wash jars and lids prior to beginning. Place jars on cookie sheets in a 200 degree oven while cooking the berries. Pour almost boiling water over lids in a heat proof bowl or pan. Lay an old towel on a spare table or countertop near by. Remove a sheet of jars. Ladle hot jam into a glass pyrex measuring cup and pour carefully into each jar leaving 1/4 in of space at the top. Wipe up any spills around the edges to provide a clean seal.. 
  4. Remove tops from water and dry completely. Place a top and ring carefully on each jar. They will be very hot!!!. 
  5. Place each jar upside down on the towel set aside. Use caution! Hot!!! Let sit to cool and set for 24 hours.. 
  6. Flip over and check for any tops that didn't seal. If they have any give at all put them in the fridge for use within a month. All of mine sealed perfectly this way. The jam became more solid after refrigeration. Don't be alarmed if it looks runny when you open it at room temp..
