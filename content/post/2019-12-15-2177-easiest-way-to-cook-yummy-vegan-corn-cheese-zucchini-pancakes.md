**Vegan corn cheese zucchini pancakes**. Not sweet pancakes, but savory ones. Back before I became a vegan, I had a zucchini pancake recipe I loved, which came together with shredded zucchini, flour, and egg whites. I've long wanted to veganize it and amp up the color with more veggies. 

<img src="https://img-global.cpcdn.com/recipes/f9e65f90241ecda8/751x532cq70/vegan-corn-cheese-zucchini-pancakes-recipe-main-photo.jpg" alt="Vegan corn cheese zucchini pancakes" style="width: 100%;" /> Zucchini Corn Pancakes &#8211; These easy pancakes are the perfect side dish or appetizer to any meal. And best of all, they don't even taste "healthy"! All you need is a few pantry ingredients, freshly grated zucchini, corn kernels and your favorite kind of cheese. You can cook Vegan corn cheese zucchini pancakes using 8 ingredients and 4 steps. Here is how you achieve that. 

### Ingredients of Vegan corn cheese zucchini pancakes

  1. Prepare 180 ml of nondairy milk or water. 
  2. Prepare 120 g of oats. 
  3. Prepare 70 g of corn flour. 
  4. Prepare 2 tbs. of nutricional yeast. 
  5. You need 1 tbs. of lemon juice. 
  6. You need of salt and pepper. 
  7. It&#8217;s 1 of chopped onion (purple). 
  8. Prepare 1 of grated zucchini. 

These Savory Zucchini Cornmeal Pancakes fall into the cheesy category. Not too cheesy, but subtly so thanks to a few tablespoons of nutritional yeast in the mix. Since these pancakes are obviously not syrup-soaking appropriate, I topped this stack with a dollop of Kite Hill Chive Cream Cheese. These healthy zucchini pancakes are made with a blend of whole-grain, gluten-free flours, and are free from dairy and eggs. 

### Vegan corn cheese zucchini pancakes step by step

  1. Blend everything exept onion and zucchini. 
  2. Transfer in a bowl and add onion and zucchini. 
  3. Bake in a pan on each side for 2-3 min. 
  4. Serve with fresh tomatos. 

In a large mixing bowl, beat eggs. These vegan zucchini and corn patties are quick, healthy and easy to make. I used rice flour as the binding agent in these patties, you can also use all purpose flour or chickpea flour (besan) in place. You can eat them as such and put them inside your burger or sandwich. Okay, a bit dramatic, but seriously I didn't think it was possible to make low-fat pancakes be delicious and also be vegan, gluten-free.
