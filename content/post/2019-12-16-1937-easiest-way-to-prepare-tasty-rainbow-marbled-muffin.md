This week we did a rainbow marble painting process art activity, and it reminded me why I did this The first time I heard "marble art," I had no clue what to expect. When I first saw it, I decided it was. Once the muffins are at room temperature, using a small spatula or butter knife, liberally spread each muffin with the frosting. Alternatively, pipe the icing on to the muffins using a piping bag. This bold, bright party cake features layers of marbled vanilla cake sandwiched between fluffy bubblegum buttercream.
