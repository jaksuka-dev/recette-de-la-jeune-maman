**Spicy Hobak Jjigae (Korean Squash Stew) with Pork & Tofu**. Gochujang Jjigae (Gochujang Stew with Zucchini). Gochujang adds lots of spicy, robust flavors to this simple stew made with summer zucchini and potatoes. Other times, we also love pork for a rich, meaty stew.

The broth is made with dried anchovy stock so it's not. Fish sauce, garlic, ginger, green chili pepper, green onion, ground black pepper, hot pepper paste, onion, pork belly, pork shoulder, potato, sesame oil, tofu, water. You can cook Spicy Hobak Jjigae (Korean Squash Stew) with Pork & Tofu using 9 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you achieve that. 

### Ingredients of Spicy Hobak Jjigae (Korean Squash Stew) with Pork & Tofu

  1. Prepare 1/2 of onion, diced. 
  2. Prepare 1-2 of jalapeños, cut into 1/8" thick slices. 
  3. It&#8217;s 2-4 of garlic cloves peeled and smashed (or chopped). 
  4. You need 1/2 pound of pork shoulder, thinly sliced. 
  5. You need 1/4 cup of dwenjang (Korean soybean paste) OR miso (which is the Japanese version). 
  6. Prepare 1/4 cup of gochujang (Korean chili paste). 
  7. You need 4 cups of water. 
  8. You need 4 cups of calabacita squash or zucchini, cut into 1/2" thick slices (about 2 to 3 medium squashes).

Korean gochujang hobak jjigae is gochujang, zucchini, tofu, shiitake, and onion mingles together in wonderfully aromatic anchovy soup. Many Korean dishes rely on anchovy stock as the base flavor, not unlike dashi stock in Japanese dishes. If you have a reliable access to Korean market, you can. Sundubu Jjigae is Korean stew made with soft (uncurdled) tofu. 

### Spicy Hobak Jjigae (Korean Squash Stew) with Pork & Tofu step by step

  1. Put all ingredients except squash and tofu in a pot, cover, turn the heat to medium high, and cook for 15 minutes.. 
  2. Give the jjigae a few good stirs. You'll see the jjigae change color as the dwenjang and gochujang dissolve into the broth. Let the jjigae continue cooking uncovered for 2 to 3 minutes until it comes to a boil.. 
  3. Add squash, give it a few good stirs, and cook another 15 minutes covered.. 
  4. Crumble tofu into the jjigae. (This is not typical &#8211; usually it's cut into cubes or slices &#8211; but I like it this way because the tofu picks up more flavor from the broth.) Cover and cook another 10 minutes. Don't worry that the broth is constantly boiling rather than simmering. Jjigae gets its well developed pungency from this constant application of higher heat and the resulting compounding, melding, and reduction of flavors.. 
  5. At this point, give everything another good stir and see if you need to adjust the seasoning. If it tastes fine, you're done. If a little too salty, add a touch of water. If you want more saltiness, you can add a little more dwenjang and/or gochujang, remembering that the gochujang is much hotter (as in spicy) than the dwenjang. If you do adjust the seasoning, let it boil another 4 or 5 minutes to let the new level of seasoning meld. That's it. Enjoy!. 

As you can imagine, the tofu texture is silky soft and because of that, this tofu is also a In general, the stew is spicy. It can potentially make you sneeze while you're cooking and may even tickle your throat. The spiciness is also easy to customize to your liking &#8211; just go easy on the Korean hot pepper paste initially Your jjigae looks wonderful! I recommend cooking the jjigae using the dolsot. It gives a deep rich Now I dont have to go to BCD everytime i crave it.
