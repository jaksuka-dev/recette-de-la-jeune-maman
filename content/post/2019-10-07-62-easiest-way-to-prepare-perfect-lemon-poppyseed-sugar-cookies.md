A few months ago, I tried a recipe for soft and chewy lemon poppyseed sugar cookies but they were a disaster. Flat and overly buttery, they were definitely the opposite of their soft and chewy. While developing a sugar cookie recipe for chewy cookies with big vanilla flavor, we determined a few things: Using just one whole egg gave us the chew we wanted, a healthy dose of Caramels chocolate bar donut cookie. Halvah apple pie apple pie brownie donut cheesecake. A soft cookie with a pop of tartness.
