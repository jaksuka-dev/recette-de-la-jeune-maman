**Ukrainian Vushka (Mushroom dumplings)**. Ukrainian vushka are served in clear broth with borsch on Christmas Eve. Vushka are plump mushroom-and onion-filled dumplings resembling tortellini. "Vushka" means little ears in Ukrainian, and with their curvy whorls, that's just what they look like, especially when they turn bright red in a bowl of borscht served for Sviata Vecheria, the traditional. My recipe for Ukrainian vushka for borscht uses Asian dumpling wrappers to save time.

Step by step photos AND a new video showing you how to make this Ukrainian Babka recipe! These plump, mushroom filled dumplings are usually served with Borscht, placed right into the bowl of soup served with smetana (sour cream) on top. Lenten borshch with "vushka" is a traditional western Ukrainian dish cooked exactly for the Holy Supper. Vushka are a kind of dumplings, like ravioli or potstickers, with lenten mushrooms stuffing. Lenten transparent borshch may be sometimes dressed with garlic but do as you like.
