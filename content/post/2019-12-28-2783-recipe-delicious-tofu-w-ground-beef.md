This Ground Pork Stir Fry with Tofu is an easy and flavorful recipe that comes together in a flash. I love it on weeknights, served with steamed white rice. This is one of those recipes that I make again and again and again. Generally I don't cook a ton of repeat dishes, just because there's only so much food. I have leftover ground beef mixture from dumplings(i know usually you use pork but for some religious reason he couldn't eat pork) and have a block of silken tofu.
