Note: My mixed vegetables consist of Carrots, Green Beans, and Sweet Peas but feel free to use any choice of Vegetables. Hi guys, this is my first video on my channel so i decided to welcome you by sharing my favourite quick and easy jollof rice recipe mixed with.

Spaghetti should be cooked with a very big pot. That is to say, the pot should contain the spaghetti and still have plenty of unused volume. This jollof rice hack had me doing cat wheels in my kitchen. I had used this recipe years ago, but I never thought to post it until recently. I think Jollof rice can provide world peace, just give these disgruntled countries some Jollof rice and watch them all enjoy together and you would be surprised.
