  6. The dough will be sticky so make sure you coat your hands with some flour before doing the next step.. 
  7. Mix the dough with your hands, but not too much. You do not want the dough to be smooth at all.. 
  8. Now take chunks of dough and place inside the baking pan just as you see in the picture above.. 
  9. Brush each piece of biscuit dough with melter butter and bake about 20 minutes or until top is brown.. 
 10. The edges will have a little crunch that adds some good flavor.. 
 11. Very thick and moist biscuit and it is good with some honey, preserves, butter, bacon, sausage, eggs or just plain..
