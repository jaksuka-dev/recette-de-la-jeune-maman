**Tofu Steak**. The tofu in this recipe is cooked like a steak &#8211; seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic cooked till crispy on the outside and hot in the middle. I like to serve with an assortment of chargrilled veg and mushrooms and soy sauce and wasabi as condiments. Tofu Steaks can be made with spice rubs, a variety of sauces, or simple citrus and herbs. 

<img src="https://img-global.cpcdn.com/recipes/17ebefb32393883a/751x532cq70/tofu-steak-recipe-main-photo.jpg" alt="Tofu Steak" style="width: 100%;" /> Now dip the sauced tofu steak into the breadcrumbs and use your hands to help pat the breadcrumbs onto the tofu. Start with a block of extra-firm tofu. In one small bowl, whisk together a batter from some non-dairy milk, flour, flaxseed, vinegar, soy sauce, and garlic. You can cook Tofu Steak using 7 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you achieve it. 

### Ingredients of Tofu Steak

  1. You need 1 Block of Tofu. 
  2. You need 1 Bunch of Green Onions or Chives, chopped. 
  3. You need 1 of red onion, chopped. 
  4. It&#8217;s 2 cloves of garlic, minced. 
  5. It&#8217;s of Mayonnaise. 
  6. It&#8217;s of Cooking oil. 
  7. You need to taste of Salt & Pepper. 

In another bowl, whisk together a breading from some panko breadcrumbs, flour, paprika, thyme, salt and pepper. Requiring only pantry staples, it's the perfect dish for busy weeknights. The flavor of this dish comes from the sauce-it's the salty-sour kick and the sweet, mellow onions that make it mouthwatering. This recipe also uses one of the most basic cooking methods, sautéing, making this an easy side dish or main dish. 

### Tofu Steak step by step

  1. Slice tofu into thin lengthwise cuts and fry in hot oil until golden or crisp.. 
  2. Let it cool. Then cut into bite size pieces like in the photo.. 
  3. Heat another pan, sauté the garlic and onion in a little oil. Add spoonfuls of mayonnaise. How much depends on how much tofu you have. It should coat it all, but not dripping or wet.. 
  4. Drop in the green onions/chives/scallions. It's all the same thing. Mix in with the mayo well.. 
  5. Add the tofu bites into the mayo mix. Make sure every piece is coated well. Season with salt and pepper.. 
  6. Remove from heat and enjoy as a siding or appetizer.. 

Combine the tofu, half the garlic, the stock, lime juice, oregano, salt and pepper in a large bowl or zip-top bag. Mix soy sauce, ginger, and sesame seeds together in a large pan. Spread marinated tofu onto the prepared baking sheet. Tofu is a divisive food: some people love it in any form, some only like it cooked in certain ways, while others are adamant they don't like it at all.. Cover a small baking tray with parchment paper and lay tofu on top.
