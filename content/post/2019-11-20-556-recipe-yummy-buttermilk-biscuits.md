<img src="https://img-global.cpcdn.com/recipes/b6b2b1ea7c3fa540/751x532cq70/buttermilk-biscuits-recipe-main-photo.jpg" alt="Buttermilk Biscuits" style="width: 100%;" /> You can cook Buttermilk Biscuits using 5 ingredients and 7 steps. Here is how you achieve it. 

### Ingredients of Buttermilk Biscuits

  1. You need 3 cups of White Lily self-rising Flour. 
  2. You need 1/2 cup of Crisco shortening. 
  3. It&#8217;s 1 tbsp of baking powder. 
  4. You need 3/4 cup of buttermilk. 
  5. You need 1/2 stick of butter (melted). 

### Buttermilk Biscuits step by step

  1. Preheat oven to 500 degrees. 
  2. In large mixing bowl sift flour with baking powder. Cut in the shortening and work in with hands until you have beads of flour mixture.. 
  3. Add buttermilk into flour mixture. Stir with wooden spoon until all flour is wet. Again work with hands to until dough is ready to pour out and cut.. 
  4. Place dough on floured surface and either press out or roll with rolling pin to about 3/4 inch tall. Cut with biscuit cutter and place on greased cookie sheet. Place biscuits next to each other for maximum rise.. 
  5. I allow biscuits to rest for 5-10 minutes prior to popping in oven. Bake for 15 minutes until golden brown.. 
  6. When you first pull out of oven brush with melted butter. Enjoy.. 
  7. I know some will ask why use self-rising flour and then add baking powder. I have found through testing that this recipe gives maximum rise and tenderness to the biscuits. You may find through your own trial and error that you prefer less rise and/or a more firm biscuit..
