**Gumbo with shrimp and sausage/bangers. 🙂**. Some gumbos do contain sausage, shrimp and chicken, but there are humbler ones that are made with only salt pork, onions and greens. Finally, there is the filé powder camp. These cooks use copious amounts of the stuff, which is made from finely powdered sassafras leaves.

This fabulous shrimp gumbo is flavored with some spicy andouille sausage, tomatoes, and the "holy trinity" of Cajun and Creole cooking: onion, celery. My take on a hearty New Orleans Gumbo with shrimp and sausage! You can cook Gumbo with shrimp and sausage/bangers. 🙂 using 18 ingredients and 8 steps. Here is how you cook that.

I'm making the roux from scratch so it's extra flavorful! I substituted Keilbasa sausage as could not locate andouille and it worked great! Roux was not that difficult but requires patience 🙂. Shrimp Gumbo is like a trip to New Orleans without the plane ticket. 

### Gumbo with shrimp and sausage/bangers. 🙂 instructions

  1. De-stem and de-seed your bells and cut them up.. 
  2. Dump your cans in a (stockpot) (do not drain).. 
  3. Cut up your sausage/bangers and de-tail your shrimp. and dump them in the pot.. 
  4. Add your spices to your liking (I used about 7 big scoops for all the spices).. 
  5. Cook rice in a separate pot.. 
  6. After the gumbos ready put the 2 kinds of cheese on top (it will melt).. 
  7. Enjoy. ❤🙂. 
  8. Stuff you will need. 🙂. 

The secret is in the slow-cooked roux — don't skip it! Serve with white rice for soaking up the rich sauce. You could also prepare the gumbo up to the point before you add the shrimp, and then chill and refrigerate for a day or two. In this cooking video The Wolfe Pit shows you how to make a perfect rich roux and how to make a delicious rich Cajun Shrimp and Sausage Gumbo. "Porch Blues".
