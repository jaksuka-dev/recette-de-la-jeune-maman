Growing up in California, we were always spoiled by huge crops of citrus. Preserved lemons bring bright notes of citrus, vibrant saltiness and muted, complex tartness to your cooking. They gain their characteristic flavor through long, slow fermentation, and it's this traditional. Preserved lemons are an important ingredient in many Moroccan and Middle Eastern recipes. The lemons are preserved in a simple mixture of salt and their own juices.
