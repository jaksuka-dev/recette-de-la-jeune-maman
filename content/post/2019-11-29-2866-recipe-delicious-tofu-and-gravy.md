The smooth, silky egg tofu coated in savory mushroom gravy sauce paired with a bowl of rice is THE definition of Asian comfort food! When it comes to tofus, egg tofu is the king of all tofus for us. You can have Tofu and Gravy using 8 ingredients and 4 steps. Here is how you achieve that.

### Tofu and Gravy instructions

  1. I used Indonesian tofu which is a bit thin and big. But you can use a regular tofu and slice them in two or even four, up to you. Fry the tofu until golden brown and set aside.. 
  2. Heat the pan. I prefer not to use oil in this, but it's your call. Add the ground beef and stir until it becomes brown. Add garlic, onion, bouillon cube, and worcestershire sauce.. 
  3. Stir continuously until well-combined. Add cream and stir for a minute or so.. 
  4. Pour the gravy on top of the fried tofu.. 

Place seasoned tofu in a single layer on a prepared baking sheet and spray with cooking spray. Tofu Gravy Goes well with chapathi,roti, Phulkas, kulchas, rice, pulao's and fried rice. Tofu is a curd made from the milk of pressed soybeans. It has a gelatinous texture and doesn't really have a flavor of its own. The incoherent ramblings of a Fairly Odd TOFU MOM.
