It's the perfect slow cooker dish to make for the entire family. Budget-friendly lean chuck steak or round steak may be used as well. The soy sauce and tomatoes make the perfect sauce for the beef and peppers, and a little garlic powder rounds out the flavors. Season the flank steak with salt and pepper and place into a slow cooker. Prepare the steak in advance and leave everything alone in a slow cooker.
