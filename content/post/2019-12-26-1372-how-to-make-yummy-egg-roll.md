These homemade egg rolls are filled with pork and vegetables, all wrapped up and fried to crispy perfection. The perfect make-ahead appetizer for any event! You can have Egg roll using 5 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you achieve that. 

### Ingredients of Egg roll

  1. It&#8217;s 3 of eggs. 
  2. Prepare 1/4 cup of fresh milk. 
  3. It&#8217;s 1 tsp of salt.

Egg rolls are a quintessential Chinese takeout appetizer. I used an eight inch iron skillet that worked out perfectly. Egg rolls are a classic appetizer at Chinese restaurants, but there are also many simple simple varieties to make at home yourself and enjoy anytime. Baking egg rolls definitely creates a different texture than frying, but I still liked them A LOT. 

### Egg roll step by step

  1. Beat the eggs in a bowl then season with salt and add the milk.. 
  2. Spread a thin layer of oil on your pan. Then pour a small amount of the egg mixture just enough to cover the pan.. 
  3. Add cheese on top then carefully roll the omelette into a log shape. Roll as tightly as possible. The first roll usually isnt perfect but its okay.. 
  4. Slide the rolled egg back to the other side and repeat steps 2 and 3. 
  5. Once its done, set aside to cool before slicing. Slice tamagoyaki into 1/2 inch slices.. 
  6. Serve warm :). 

I also experimented with freezing the egg rolls uncooked. After freezing I put them straight into a hot oven. Homemade egg rolls can be a big production. Wrapping and frying can add a ton of time and cleanup. (We should knowâ€”we've fried a ton, including Chicken Parm Egg Rolls and Banana Pudding Egg. An egg roll is an appetizer that includes meat or vegetables wrapped inside dough and steamed or deep Several things characterize a true egg roll.
