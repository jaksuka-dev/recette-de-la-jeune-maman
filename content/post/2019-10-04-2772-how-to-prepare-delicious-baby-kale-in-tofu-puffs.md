**Baby Kale in Tofu Puffs**. If you are puzzled with my excitement, please bear with me &#8211; Emily, the drama queen. That's what happen when you're deprived from Asian groceries. \*Try again\* When the tofu puffs are added in curries and stir fries, they can soak up all the flavours around them. Choosing Kale for Baby: Kale comes in two main varieties- kale with flat, smooth leaves like dino kale (also called lacianto) or curled, crinkly leaves The amount will vary depending on the age of the plant and how it was farmed, but it should be noted that nitrate levels in kale are considerably lower than.

Say goodbye to soft tofu and say hello to crispy fried perfection, served up with tender kale on a bed of fluffy rice. Bring small pot of water to a boil and place the unwrapped block of tofu in the water. You can have Baby Kale in Tofu Puffs using 4 ingredients and 2 steps. Here is how you cook that. 

### Ingredients of Baby Kale in Tofu Puffs

  1. It&#8217;s half a catty (ca. 1 cup) of kale. 
  2. It&#8217;s 4 pcs of tofu puffs, cut. 
  3. You need slices of Garlic and ginger. 
  4. You need 1 pinch of salt. 

Gradually add kale a few handfuls at a time, stirring to let it wilt down. We used baby kale in the recipe and I was able to eat it. It was even better on the second day for lunch as leftovers. I really liked the spicy flavor. 

### Baby Kale in Tofu Puffs step by step

  1. Remove the flower of kale then wash. Soak in a salt water for 10 mins. Then wash again and drain. Boil water in a pot then black kale and set aside.. 
  2. In a hot wok stir fry slice tofu puffs until brown then remove. In same wok stir fry garlic and ginger. Then add kale mix it. Add salt and little water then cover and cook until done.. 

Tofu puffs or cubed store-bought spiced/marinated tofu are also suitable options. Cook the noodles separate from the soup and add them just before serving. Can I use baby kale instead of the full size regular kale? I'm hoping to make the recipe tonight. This veggie-packed scrambled tofu packs a nutritious punch, while baked sweet potato fries make a delicious side-dish.
