Simple, delicious, and totally comforting, this White Cheddar Mac and Cheese is the perfect quick fix for weeknight dinners. Add the cooked and drained pasta, broccoli, and chopped chicken back to the skillet with the sauce I use this recipe but I also add a cup of chopped mushrooms with the broccoli. Place macaroni into the baking dish and pour the cheese mixture over the pasta, mixing well. Somewhere in the midst of that conversation, I mentioned that I had just made an epic batch of Broccoli Chicken Mac & Cheese earlier that day, but had writer's block and couldn't think of what on earth to write about it other than. Tastes like broccoli cheese soup in mac and cheese form!
