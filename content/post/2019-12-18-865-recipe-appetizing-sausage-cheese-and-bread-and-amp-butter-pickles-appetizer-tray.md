### Sausage, Cheese, and Bread & Butter Pickles, Appetizer Tray step by step

  1. Grill sausage. Place on a plate with cheese, pickles, & sauce.. 

Regular Italian sausage works great for this, but I prefer to use the hot version of Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage, and add shredded pepper jack cheese for the extra kick they. Place the bread, seam side down, on the prepared baking sheet and brush the top of the bread with the remaining egg wash. Brown the sausage in a skillet and drain well. Beat the eggs into a bowl and add the splash of milk, ground mustard, and salt and pepper to taste. In batches, dip the biscuits into the egg mixture and place in a bundt pan.
